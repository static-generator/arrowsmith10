# Everywhere At The End Of An Unsaved Game
## Gabriel D. Callo 9 - Arrowsmith

**Everywhere At The End Of An Unsaved Game: Reincarnate is a a fanmade EATEOT project which shows what effects dementia will do to a senile mind in the modern ages. It will also touch on their mood, recollection, and brain. This project is a remaster of the original EATEOAUG, with inspiration from projects such as Anywhere At The End Of The Charger (Original and Platinum), Grandiose Recollection and Beautiful Years and Memories Begin From Nowhere. This project will aim to sampling media from the years 1930 to today.**

THIS PROJECT IS HOSTED BY GAB WITH MEMBERS OF HAMSTER, OSHIC, MIGHTYZEALOT, CBG, AND MORE.

# STAGE 1
(Phase 1) June 23, 2079
Here we finally begin our long trip. However, Alzheimer’s Disease has still not tainted itself on our patients mind. In this segment, nothing is wrong. Recollection is still as bright as day. Memories here take no effort to recall as they reminisce about the golden days with their family and friends. There is also nothing wrong about their mood, all the good memories make for a happy life. Symptoms about Alzheimers Disease are nonexistent with the only signs of disorientation being about old age. 

(Phase 2) October 2, 2079
This segment is the exact same as the last with the only difference being that Alzheimer’s Disease has successfully burrowed into the patients mind. However, the patients memory is still in perfect condition. The only problem being with very old memories when they were a young child. Other than that, everything is still alright. Recollection still takes no effort to recall. By the end of stage, we successfully transition to stage 1. The harbinger of disaster.

# STAGE 2
(Phase 1) March 3, 2080
Here we finally transition to stage 2, which marks the beginning of the end. This phase shows that there is no problem in recalling memories, and our patient is still content and joyful being in his golden years. Only a handful of memories here are fuzzy but other than that everything is fine. However there is still no thought about Alzheimer’s Disease burrowing into their mind a few months ago. The patient is unaware of this. While still unaware, Alzheimer’s disease taints their mind for the first time with no thought of it.
Ignorance is bliss after all.

(Phase 2) July 28, 2080 
This phase is similar to the last phase but the difference being that more memories here are now more hazy and fuzzy. Things and objects continue to get misplaced. Like your shoes ending up in the bedroom or your keys are found in the kitchen cabinet, why would this happen? This phase also marks the beginning where our patient begins to forget certain details like forgetting to lock the door or turn off the lights. The patient would pass this off as old age or a bad nights sleep. By the end of this phase the patient would begin to doubt whether if its just their age, but something else entirely. The patient would dismiss these thoughts carrying on to live their now imperfect life. 

(Phase 3) November 1, 2080
This phase marks the very beginning of Medical Stage 2, where the same old ridiculous thought dosen’t leave our patients mind. A thought that everything is off. The pieces start to click together, the idea starts making sense! “Maybe i’m overthinking it!” The patient would once again pass this idea off. more memories and recollection here continue to get hazy but still recognizable as the most specific details of these memories begin to blur. All the recollection here are the truly last memories of content before we transition to stage 3.
