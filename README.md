# Everywhere At The End Of An Unsaved Game
## Gabriel D. Callo 9 - Arrowsmith

**Everywhere At The End Of An Unsaved Game: Reincarnate is a a fanmade EATEOT project which shows what effects dementia will do to a senile mind in the modern ages. It will also touch on their mood, recollection, and brain. This project is a remaster of the original EATEOAUG, with inspiration from projects such as Anywhere At The End Of The Charger (Original and Platinum), Grandiose Recollection and Beautiful Years and Memories Begin From Nowhere. This project will aim to sampling media from the years 1930 to today.**

THIS PROJECT IS HOSTED BY GAB WITH MEMBERS OF HAMSTER, OSHIC, MIGHTYZEALOT, CBG, AND MORE.

# STAGE 1
(Phase 1) June 23, 2079
Here we finally begin our long trip. However, Alzheimer’s Disease has still not tainted itself on our patients mind. In this segment, nothing is wrong. Recollection is still as bright as day. Memories here take no effort to recall as they reminisce about the golden days with their family and friends. There is also nothing wrong about their mood, all the good memories make for a happy life. Symptoms about Alzheimers Disease are nonexistent with the only signs of disorientation being about old age. 
(Phase 2) October 2, 2079
This segment is the exact same as the last with the only difference being that Alzheimer’s Disease has successfully burrowed into the patients mind. However, the patients memory is still in perfect condition. The only problem being with very old memories when they were a young child. Other than that, everything is still alright. Recollection still takes no effort to recall. By the end of stage, we successfully transition to stage 1. The harbinger of disaster.
